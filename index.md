### Neuroscientist and Psychologist

Currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, my research is focused on uncovering how traumatic psychological experiences leave a lasting imprint on the brain.  The central aim of this work is to understand how trauma leads to devastating afflictions like PTSD and addiction, and how we can harness these insights to advance new treatments.

My research employs a multi-level approach to understanding trauma.  Techniques involved include in vivo calcium imaging of neural activity, tissue clearing and whole-brain analysis of stress responses, persistent labeling of stress-reactive cells in the service of molecularly profiling and manipulation, chemogenetic/optogenetic circuit mapping, and behavioral models of neuropsychiatric dysfunction.

I also devote a large amount of my spare time to creating convenient open-source tools that allow the neuroscience community to more readily adopt modern technologies.  I am lead developer of the behavior tracking software [ezTrack](https://github.com/DeniseCaiLab/ezTrack), contributor to the calcium imaging analysis software [Minian](https://github.com/denisecailab/minian), have built open-source tools for counting cells in microscopy images, and share protocols for these and other neuroscience techniques here.
